## About
This ROS package is intended to support searches for particular predefined shape primitives in pointclouds. Currently it supports locating planes and cylidners within a pointcloud scene with expected locations and orientations (or without these specified). This package depends on the [pointcloud_processing_server](https://github.com/UTNuclearRoboticsPublic/pointcloud_processing_server)

The above image illustrates an example, with the server finding three planes (two walls and the floor) and two cylindrical ducts within an example scene, recorded from real data.
