## About
<img src=images/tunnel_inspection.png width="400">
This ROS package is intended to support searches for particular predefined shape primitives in pointclouds. Currently it supports locating planes and cylidners within a pointcloud scene with expected locations and orientations (or without these specified). This package depends on the [pointcloud_processing_server](https://github.com/UTNuclearRoboticsPublic/pointcloud_processing_server)
